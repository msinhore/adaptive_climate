### **Automatic Device Selection Configuration**
The `auto_device_selection` option enables intelligent device selection based on device capabilities and current conditions:

**When Enabled (`auto_device_selection: true`)**:
- **Automatic Optimization**: System automatically selects the best climate devices for each season
- **Type-Based Selection**: Prioritizes devices based on their capabilities (heat_only, cool_only, dual, fan_dry_only)
- **Seasonal Intelligence**: Adapts device selection based on winter, summer, or shoulder seasons
- **Manual Override**: Ignores user-configured `primary_climates` and `secondary_climates` settings

**When Disabled (`auto_device_selection: false`)**:
- **Manual Control**: Uses user-configured device roles
- **Predictable Behavior**: Maintains consistent device assignments
- **Full Control**: User has complete control over which devices act as primary/secondary

**Device Selection Logic**:
- **Winter**: Prioritizes `heat_only` or `dual` devices with heating capabilities
- **Summer**: Prioritizes `cool_only` or `dual` devices with cooling capabilities  
- **Shoulder Seasons**: Uses `dual` devices or `fan_dry_only` based on comfort needs
- **Capability Ranking**: Considers device features like temperature control and HVAC mode support

**Configuration Examples**:
```yaml
# Automatic device selection (recommended for multi-device setups)
auto_device_selection: true

# Manual device selection (traditional approach)
auto_device_selection: false
primary_climates: ["climate.living_room_ac"]
secondary_climates: ["climate.bedroom_ac"]
```

### **Enable Off Mode Configuration**
The `enable_off_mode` option controls whether the system can turn off the air conditioning when it's not needed for comfort. This is particularly useful for:

- **Preventing Short Cycling**: When disabled, the system will use fan-only mode instead of turning off completely, which can help prevent rapid on/off cycles
- **Maintaining Air Circulation**: Some users prefer to keep the fan running for better air circulation even when heating/cooling isn't needed
- **Equipment Protection**: For sensitive HVAC equipment that shouldn't be turned off frequently

**Configuration Examples:**
```yaml
# Standard configuration (AC can turn off)
enable_off_mode: true

# Conservative configuration (AC stays on with fan)
enable_off_mode: false
```

**Behavior:**
- **`enable_off_mode: true`**: System can turn AC completely off when comfort conditions are met
- **`enable_off_mode: false`**: System will use fan-only mode instead of turning off, maintaining air circulation

#### **Fan Speed Control**
| Option | Description | Default | Options |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Minimum Fan Speed** | Lowest fan speed the system can use | Low | Low/Mid/High/Highest |
| **Maximum Fan Speed** | Highest fan speed the system can use | High | Low/Mid/High/Highest |

#### **System Control**
| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Enable Energy Save Mode** | Reduces HVAC usage by prioritizing ventilation and comfort tolerance | ‚úÖ Enabled |
| **Enable Auto Mode** | Enables autonomous operation. Disable for fully manual control | ‚úÖ Enabled |

    temperature_change_threshold: 1.0  # Increase from default 0.5¬∞C
    enable_off_mode: false  # Use fan-only instead of turning off completely
    # ... other settings ...
```

**Threshold Guidelines**:
- **0.5¬∞C**: Very sensitive (default, may cause frequent cycles)
- **1.0¬∞C**: Balanced approach (recommended)
- **1.5¬∞C**: Conservative (good for equipment longevity)
- **2.0¬∞C**: Very conservative (minimal changes)

### **Enable Off Mode Feature (v1.3.2)**

**Configuration Examples**:
```yaml
# Standard configuration (AC can turn off)
enable_off_mode: true

# Conservative configuration (AC stays on with fan)
enable_off_mode: false
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Prevents short cycling of AC compressors
- ‚úÖ Maintains air circulation when disabled
- ‚úÖ Protects sensitive HVAC equipment
- ‚úÖ Improves energy efficiency when enabled
